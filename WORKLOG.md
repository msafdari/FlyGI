# FlyGI worklog

This file records durable checkpoints, measured results, limitations, and the
next implementation steps. Large upstream and generated artifacts remain local
and are not stored in normal Git history.

## 2026-09-19 — Milestones 0–1 and full-data checkpoint

### Completed

- Created the Python 3.12 repository, locked its dependencies, and implemented
  the Milestones 0–1 package, CLI, configs, documentation, tests, and Kaggle
  adapter plumbing.
- Added a root `AGENTS.md` operating directive requiring worklog-first recovery,
  frequent small verified commits, periodic pushes to the private remote, and
  strict exclusion of downloaded/generated artifacts from normal Git history.
- Pinned the official ARC-AGI-3 agent framework at
  `4743e7d0aaae0ded0d98a89a7e282e63564cd58b` and the starter interface at
  `eeb1535404f321d280a8f9194bbc1d7aca5f05fc`.
- Downloaded all three required MaleCNS v1.0 Feather tables: 1,109,008,094
  bytes in total. No individual-synapse tables, skeletons, meshes, segmentation
  volumes, or EM imagery were downloaded.
- Compiled the literal-rate graph with strict source schemas, ascending 64-bit
  body IDs, `W[post, pre]` edge orientation, `log1p` weights, unsigned edges,
  incoming-L1 normalization, no self-edges, and the declared nonempty
  `superclass` node filter.
- Refreshed the locked ARC dependencies and cached all 25 currently public game
  packages for strict-offline use.
- Published the repository privately at <https://github.com/msafdari/FlyGI>.

### Verification results

- `uv run pytest`: 25 tests passed.
- Ruff lint and formatting checks passed.
- Wheel build and generated-notebook schema validation passed.
- `flygi validate all --require-data` passed and rehashed all three sources and
  all three runtime assets.
- The official-style 50-action `ls20,vc33` local verification passed offline.
- Every cached public game imported, initialized, reset, and accepted at least
  one legal action in strict-offline mode.
- A public-set random-baseline run completed in all 25 games without an
  exception. The requested 200-action ceiling was reduced by the adapter's
  existing `MAX_ACTIONS=80` safety cap, for 2,000 total actions. It completed
  one level in `sp80`; this is a smoke result, not evidence about connectome
  performance.

### Measured MaleCNS build

| Measurement | Observed value |
| --- | ---: |
| Source directed edge rows | 151,856,684 |
| Source synaptic-contact weight sum | 311,833,243 |
| Annotated neurons | 211,577 |
| Retained neurons | 166,700 |
| Runtime nonzero directed edges | 25,582,837 |
| Retained synaptic-contact weight sum | 124,177,143 |
| Descending-neuron group | 1,314 |
| Disconnected retained nodes | 217 |
| Dropped rows with missing annotations | 125,828,298 |
| Dropped rows due to node filtering | 445,448 |
| Dropped retained self-edges | 101 |

The build took approximately 14 minutes on the development machine and peaked
at roughly 3.6 GB observed resident memory. The compressed runtime is about
101 MB in total; `graph.npz` itself is 90,033,466 bytes.

### Recorded hashes

The source digests below were observed during download and reverified locally.
The publisher did not provide an independent expected SHA-256, so they must not
be described as publisher-preverified.

| Artifact | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| Source weights | `e35da783d1c686b2b58b3b87cd6a403ae43bfcfba8bff28e08ef752c1a56afc1` |
| Source annotations | `2177e246113e4cfbf1e7772ec37c6da1955ff22e8063d0b1f833101f99a9a3b2` |
| Source neurotransmitters | `95c9289220663abeb3409f3ad9e5a7f8a53f8093f5139d15502cd08da8879621` |
| Runtime graph | `99c9441be6e6ac89eb20c3c17162308240f2e4326003d97a4e5034e998be8acc` |
| Runtime node metadata | `2a84309be4f1ea860032476390de1ffa3b8ce635710898a13466a29e4d00eb0c` |
| Runtime groups | `09736379ce989268080f57b64f357e800cf446972007c1af2287a86b9985a89d` |

### Findings and decisions

- The aggregate weights table contains 151.9 million rows, but only 25.6
  million nonzero edges remain after restricting both endpoints to the curated
  retained neuron population and removing self-edges.
- Missing annotation endpoints account for most dropped source rows. This is a
  measured property of the selected source tables and filter, not a schema
  failure.
- The complete graph can be compiled without a dense adjacency matrix on the
  development machine. Sparse aggregation, rather than final asset size, is
  the expensive phase.
- Four ARC game downloads (`re86`, `s5i5`, `sb26`, and `sc25`) failed during
  the first pass and all succeeded on an immediate targeted retry. All 25 then
  passed strict-offline loading and action smoke tests.
- The current adapter is intentionally a deterministic random-legal baseline.
  It does not load the compiled graph, so its public-game result cannot be
  interpreted as a FlyGI/connectome result.
- The generated Milestone 0 notebook embeds FlyGI Python code but explicitly
  reports `contains_connectome_assets: false`. A hidden Kaggle evaluation is
  therefore not yet a connectome evaluation.
- No Kaggle access token is present, the notebook metadata still contains the
  username placeholder, and competition-rule acceptance has not been verified.

### Local artifacts intentionally excluded from Git

| Path | Approximate size | Reason |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `data/raw/` | 1.0 GB | Upstream MaleCNS tables |
| `data/processed/` | 101 MB | Reproducible compiled runtime |
| `environment_files/` | 3.9 MB | Downloaded public ARC game packages |
| `.venv/` | 389 MB | Reproducible virtual environment |
| `vendor/` | 1.2 MB | Reproducible pinned framework checkout |
| `notebooks/submission.ipynb` | generated | Rebuilt from tracked source |

The small acquisition manifest under `data/manifests/` is tracked because it
contains provenance rather than the downloaded tables themselves.

## Next steps

1. **Milestone 2 — full-graph dynamics.** Implement the sparse leaky rate
   backend, deterministic initialization, finite-activity tests, CPU graph-step
   benchmark, and runtime/memory measurements for internal-step counts
   `K = 1, 2, 4, 8`.
2. **Milestone 3 — closed-loop FlyGI.** Implement the fixed neutral visual
   encoder, persistent connectome state, descending-neuron trace, literal
   readout, legal-action masking, coordinate head, and declared reset policy.
   Add causal-path tests proving that changing the frame can change sensory
   input, graph activity, logits, and the selected action.
3. **Public evaluation plumbing.** Replace the placeholder evaluation modules
   with immutable result manifests, explicit seeds, action traces, failures,
   timing, and per-game summaries. Keep the random baseline separate from the
   connectome-driven agent.
4. **Offline Kaggle packaging.** Publish `graph.npz`, `node_metadata.npz`,
   `groups.npz`, the config, and reviewed manifests as a versioned private
   Kaggle Dataset. Update the notebook to load and verify these assets exactly
   once, without downloading MaleCNS or rebuilding the graph during evaluation.
5. **Kaggle identity and pipeline check.** Add the user's Kaggle token locally,
   replace the notebook username placeholder, confirm competition-rule
   acceptance, run the official random submission first, and only then run the
   connectome submission.
6. **Milestone 4 — scientific controls.** After the closed-loop agent is live,
   add seeded directed degree-preserving rewires, weight shuffles, a matched
   sparse reservoir, the no-reservoir baseline, paired evaluation, and the
   preregistered statistical analysis. Do not claim a biological advantage
   without the degree-preserving comparison.
